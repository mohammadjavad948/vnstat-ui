## About This Project

this project is using [vnStat](https://github.com/vergoh/vnstat) to monitor data, so you need it

it shows your data usage in a simple ui

## File Structure

- react-ui : contains interface made with react

First install dependencies for both **electron** and **react-ui** with yarn

Then go to react ui and serv the project with **yarn start**

After server starts. You can go to electron directory and run **yarn run start-server**

That's it. Now you can start editing codes :)
